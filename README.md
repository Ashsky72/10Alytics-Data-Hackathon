# Tackling The Health Crisis In Africa


## Problem Statement

The lack of access to adequate medical resources and facilities have led to the significant number of deaths. 
Some of these deaths could have been avoided by timely access to a medical professional or close proximity of hospitals.

Health systems across Africa are underfunded and understaffed. Less than half of African citizens (52%) – about 615 million people 
– have access to the health care they need, the quality of health services across the continent is generally poor, and family 
planning needs of half the continent’s women and girls are unmet.

Let’s focus on Africa in this dataset and provide the solutions to the health challenges, especially in Africa.

## Questions to answered by the analysis

1. What are the major causes of death in Africa?
2. How does the situation in African countries compare to other countries in other continents?
3. What is the trend of top five death causes over the last five years?
4. What is the relationship between deaths and population?
5. What is the age distribution of deaths in Africa? What age group are more at risk of dying due to diseases?
6. Are the number of medical doctors in Africa sufficient?
7. Are African governments doing enough in yearly budgets to health sector? What is the situation and what is the ideal situation?
